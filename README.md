# Notification System (Go + Pipeline)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **high-concurrency notification system** based on **Go Pipeline** design, supporting multiple notification methods (Email, SMS, Webhook), and providing high-performance, scalable notification processing capabilities through **Goroutines & Channels**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Go Pipeline Architecture**: Using Goroutines & Channels for notification processing
- **Multiple Notification Methods**: Email, SMS, Webhook
- **Rate Limiter**: Controls notification sending frequency
- **Retry Mechanism**: Automatic retry when sending fails
- **Priority Queue**: High-priority notifications are processed first
- **Context Cancellation**: Support for notification timeout or manual cancellation
- **Logging System**: Built-in logging for system monitoring

## 🔧 Installation and Running
